# Brief

Build a TODO CRUD App using [Leptos](https://leptos.dev/), the app should have the following functionality:

- Login with email and password
- Add a new todo with the todo text as the input and the created todo ID as the output
- Read an existing todo by id
- Read all todos with pagination
- Update a todo with the updated text and existing id
- Delete a todo by id

(Note that all these are per-user)


# Submittable

- URL to the public source code repository
- (Optional) Hosted URL on any free hosting service

# Additional Information

- The above code is expected to be performant and scalable and following best practices
- The app must be persistent, feel free to use any backing storage
- The app must not lose the created todos across restarts and crashes
- The app must use SSR (Server Side Rendering)
